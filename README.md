## Javascript test
</p>
<img src="static/images/java scrript feedback.png" alt="footer" width="50%" /><br>
</p>.
 - In the pictures it shows that i have used the following validatoirs for the CCS , HTML and Java. as you can see above in the html and css pictures it shows in yellow which means the error , however these arent really errors they just some syntax errors that could be improved but the code will still work as intended and the syntax are more as reccomendations then fixes. However on the java there is no errors and  much debugging isnt required. Therefore after doing the validitors i can confirm the website is working effeciently as i have tested the website after it.
- Note: that the errors arent needed to debug in the css and html as they arent really problem in the code is just how the validators see it.

### lighthouse testing 
 Google Lighthouse audits for performance, accessibility, SEO (desktop & mobile).

### **Credits**
- Ai usage =  i have used a bit of chagbt/Ai tools to help me with the project. what i mean by this is i have used the ai t to assist me quicker in order to make sure certain parts of the project is viable and used the ai tool to ask certain question about the code i have written in  so it  make sure it works and certain  syntax is correct  so that the website is  viable. i have used this to help me summerise my idea for this website i prompt it to give great recommendations for the blog and then used it to make my own type of blog in order for this project to succeed. This also went into ideas such As UX performance and allowed the performance of my work to increase which allowed my workflow to be effecient and understanding about the project.
- dbdiagram = i have used this for ERD diagram
- Coolors = for the colous and reference
- google font = took some inspiration of fonts from the website
- boostrap = took inspiration from some boostrap
